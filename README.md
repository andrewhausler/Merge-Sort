This project demonstrates the practice of implementing Merge Sort as well as working with Gradle. Merge Sort works by using recursion and dividing the array in half having a left and right side. Then it consistently calls it again and again adding each call to the call stack. Then after all method instances have been added to the call stack the calls begin to unwind as a stack starting from last in first out. Each call is a smaller portion of the initial array starting from the top of the stack moving down through the stack the size of the array keeps increasing. Each of the left and right indexes get thrown onto a temporary left and right arrays. These arrays then begin comparing themselves and putting them in order into the real array. You will usually have i, j, and k as the index names i as left, j as right, and k as the starting index of left. Then a while loop checks whenever either i or j becomes greater than or equal to the size of its temporary array. This means that either the side of left or right will be finished before the other. With that being said we need to finish adding the remaining values that either left or right may still have that haven't been placed onto the actual array. So we add two while loops for left and right depending on which one still has indexes that need adding. This process will repeat until all call stacks have been unwinded.
